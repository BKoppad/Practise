Hi Pyhon, How to get you ?

Pythonâ€™s re.compile() method is used to compile a regular expression pattern provided as a string into a regex pattern object (re.Pattern). 
Later we can use this pattern object to search for a match inside different target strings using regex methods such as a re.match() or re.search().

In simple terms, We can compile a regular expression into a regex object to look for occurrences of the same pattern inside various target strings without rewriting it.
